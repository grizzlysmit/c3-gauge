Hi this is my gauge code in c3
==============================

It is not yet portable but I will make it so in time, maybe😉  not sure if I can do it without libc and ioctl also I use signals so it may be fixed to the `*nix` world. 
Basically it uses Ansi  escape codes to implement progress bars along the bottom of a terminal.
