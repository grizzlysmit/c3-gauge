c3-gauge
========


Hi this is my gauge code in c3
------------------------------

It is not yet portable but I will make it so in time, maybe😉  not sure if I can do it without `libc` and `ioctl` also I use signals so it may be fixed to the `*nix` world. 
Basically it uses Ansi  escape codes to implement progress bars along the bottom of a terminal.

The library is basically [gauge.c3](gauge.c3l/terminal/gauge.c3) and it decencies are present as libraries here
